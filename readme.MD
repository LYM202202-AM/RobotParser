# PROYECTO-0
Python program with a simple yes/no parser.
The program read a text file that contains a program for the robot, and
verify whether the syntax is correct.

The program must verify that used function names and variable names have been previously
defined or in the case of functions, that they are the function's arguments. The program
allows recursion.
Spaces and tabulators are separators and should be ignored (outside of instructions).

## TESTS

The folder [tests](/tests/) contains 3 files:

- [test.txt](/tests/test.txt) is a valid program without recursive calls.
- [test1.txt](/tests/test1.txt)is a valid program with recursive calls.
- [test2.txt](/tests/test2.txt) is a not valid program.
